                <h2>What Is "MENTAL HEALTH"?</h2>
                <P>
                    Mental Health according to the World Health Organisation ( W H O ) is defined as 'A state of one's emotional/mental well-being that enables people to cope with the  stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn and work well, contribute to their community or the absence of mental disorder.' <br>
                    Mental disorder on the other hand is a behavioural or mental pattern that may cause suffering or a poor ability to function in life. <img src="images/cover.jpg" alt="Mental health" title="What is 'Mental Health'?" width="715" height="1011"> The impact of the internet on today's society is undeniable. With billions of users worldwide, it has become a powerfull tool for communication and collaboration. However with it's advantages it has also brought challenges, one of which is a negative impact on mental health. This awareness program aims to harness the power of the internet to promote positivity about mental health issues.

                    The purpose of this page is to raise Mental Health Awareness to help people who are impacted by mental health issues, especially young people who suffer from this conditions. <br>
                    Raising mental health awareness is not only to help people but knowing more about mental health issues to assess own risks and find help for any condition they might have. <br>
                    I think people need to understand that there is a difference between whether you are just having a bad day going through everyday challenges is a part of life and different emotions are allowed and it's okay to feel sad, angry or happy because everyone has mental health. <br>
                    However there is a difference between mental health and mental illness. If you have a mental illness then you may need to get help or just try to manage them yourself depending on how serious your mental illness is. Having a bad day won't necessarily mean you are depressed, being worried won't necessarily mean you have anxiety. So please don't worry and if you think you need help then don't hesitate to get the help you deserve.

                    Sometimes it's hard to know the difference between the regular ups and downs of life, and mental health concerns like depression and anxiety. Someone experiencing mental health concerns might feel ashamed, and worried about how their friends will react if they talk about it. <br>

                    <p>If you are not sure how to help someone with depression and anxiety, ask them. You could also offer them some options and let them choose what suits them best. For example, you could offer to listen and let them express their thoughts, or just to hangout without serious conversation. <br>
                    Try to be caring, compassionate and curious, and let them know that they matter to you and you are taking them seriously.</p>

                <p>Here are a few things you can do to feel a little better when times are tough...</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>GIVE GRATITUDE</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Making gratitude a habit begins to rewire your brain for a higher level of happiness. Neurons that fire together wire together. <br>
                        Before you sleep each night bring 5 things to mind you're gratefull for. for example:-
                        <ul>
                            <li>Breathing</li>
                            <li>Cofee</li>
                            <li>Giggles</li>
                            <li>A jam sandwich</li>
                            <li>That video of a turtle wearing a tiny hat.</li>
                        </ul>
                        Whatever it is to you. <br>
                        Not only that, but it releases oxytocin into the vegas nerve which keeps it healthy. The vegas verve is pretty important as it runs through every major organ in the body. So it's physically and mentally good for ya!.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>MOMENTS OF JOY</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Too often we are striving, for a better career, relationship, home etc. Did you know  ambition is seen as detrimental in Buddhism? This is because paradoxically it takes you away from fulfilment. <br>
                        Desire to be somewhere else either physically, psychologically and even spiritually means you are never content. Of course this doesn't mean don't have dreams. <br>
                        But for the love of God, just for one moment, stop working on yourself and feel the sun on your face. Go on, i dare you!. Do something for pure joy rather than productivity - dance, see a band, write a poem, eat cheesecake, prank your mum, learn the guitar etc. And if you feel you need permision, this is it.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>PRACTISE PRESENCE</dt>
                    <dd>
                        This is a big one. Sounds dull and it is a bit, but i promise there is a tresure trove stuck in the sands of boredom. When you are anxious, overwhelmed or simply pondering the meaninglessness of things, bring your attention to the present moment.
                        <ol>
                            <li>Take long slow breathes and with each exhale drop your awareness into your body.</li>
                            <li>Touch five things around you and notice how they feel.</li>
                            <li>Tune your inner and outer environment - whats happening?.</li>
                        </ol>
                        Practising presence has a positive knock-on-effect that impacts self-acceptance. At the least... you will feel more peaceful and less likely to punch the wall. At the most... you can reach full enlightenment. <br>
                        Yep, just by doing this. No joke. Lets do these things together.
